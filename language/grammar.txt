Grammar:

We have shapes: square, triangle, circle
We have borders: square, triangle, circle
For example we can have a small red circle in a big blue border of a square
Borders and shapes can be small, medium and big, also they can be red, blue, green
We have lines: straight with inclination oblique(positive or negative based on the direction) horizontal and vertical (the lines also have colors)

We join the parts of a figure using "&" Ex: form square & line straight inclination oblique_pos & line straight inclination oblique_neg (a square with 2 diagonals)
We use "=" to check equalty
We use "+" to add two figures Ex: form square & line straight inclination oblique_pos + line straight inclination oblique_neg = form square & line straight inclination oblique_pos & line straight inclination oblique_neg
We use "-" to substract elements of a figure Ex: form square & line straight inclination oblique_pos - line straight inclination oblique_pos = form sqaure

More examples:
form square color red size small & line straight color red inclination oblique_pos & line straight color red inclination oblique_neg - square color red size small = 
line straight color red inclination oblique_pos & line straight color red inclination oblique_neg
(if it is impossible to subsract an error is raised)

border square color red size medium & line straight color red inclination oblique_pos & line straight color red inclination oblique_neg + 
form circle color red size medium =
form circle color red size medium & line straight color red inclination oblique_neg & line straight color red inclination oblique_pos & border square color red size medium;

Games:
1.  We have n shapes, arranged in circle. In the middle a black hole with colorful border(red green or blue). 
    The child has to choose one of the shape to put in the hole, based on border color, shape and size. (We can set time limit, like a few seconds for this)
2.  We have an expression, Ex:  big square + small square = medium square
                                big circle with 2 oblique lines -  big circle = 2 oblique lines
    The child has the expression in front, and uses the menu to create the shape that is the answer.
    The expressions can become longer while advancing in levels.
    We now use shapes and lines(oblique, vertically or horizontal, maybe add something later)
3.  Memory challenge. We put a sequence of shapes, then we shuffle them and the child has to re-arange them
